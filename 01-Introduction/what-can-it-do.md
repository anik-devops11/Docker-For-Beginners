# What Can Docker Do?

Docker empowers developers and IT teams to:

1. **Containerize Applications**:
   Package applications along with their dependencies for portability.

   ```bash
   # Example: Running Redis in a container
   $ docker run redis
   ```

2. **Manage Services**:
   Run each service with its dependencies in separate containers.

3. **Simplify Deployment**:
   Deploy applications faster with fewer compatibility issues.

### Practical Applications:
- Running a web server (e.g., NGINX).
- Hosting databases (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL).
- Building scalable microservices architectures.

Docker enables developers to focus on writing code while ensuring consistent deployment environments.
