# What are Containers?

Containers are lightweight, portable units of software that package an application and its dependencies together. They ensure consistent environments from development to production.

## Key Features:
- **Process Isolation**: Containers run independently of each other using isolated processes.
- **Resource Sharing**: Multiple containers share the same OS kernel while maintaining isolation.

### How Containers Work
Containers utilize the host operating system's kernel and isolate processes, networks, and mounts. Unlike virtual machines, they donâ€™t require a full OS for each instance, making them lightweight and fast.

**Benefits:**
1. Portability: "Write once, run anywhere."
2. Efficiency: Containers use fewer resources compared to virtual machines.
3. Scalability: Easily scale individual services.

**Comparison: Containers vs Virtual Machines**
| Feature         | Containers         | Virtual Machines  |
|-----------------|--------------------|-------------------|
| Resource Usage  | Lightweight        | Heavy             |
| Boot Time       | Seconds            | Minutes           |
| Isolation       | Process-level      | Hardware-level    |
