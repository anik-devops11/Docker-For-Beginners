# Why Use Docker?

Docker addresses common challenges in software development and deployment, such as compatibility issues and lengthy setup times. By isolating applications and their dependencies, Docker ensures consistent performance across different environments.

### Key Challenges Solved:
- **Dependency Conflicts**: Different software versions coexist peacefully in separate containers.
- **Inconsistent Environments**: Uniform environments for development, testing, and production.
- **Long Setup Times**: Containers are lightweight and ready-to-run.

**Example Use Cases:**
- Microservices architecture.
- Simplified application testing.
- Rapid deployment and scaling of applications.
